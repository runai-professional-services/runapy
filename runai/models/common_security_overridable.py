Runai API

# Introduction  The Run:AI Control-Plane API reference is a guide that provides an easy-to-use programming interface for adding various tasks to your application, including workload submission, resource management, and administrative operations.  Run:ai APIs are accessed using *bearer tokens*. To obtain a token, you need to create an **Application** through the Run:ai user interface. To create an application, in your UI, go to `Settings & Tools`, `Application` and create a new Application.  After you have created a new application, you will need to assign it access rules. To assign access rules to the application, see [Create access rules](https://docs.run.ai/latest/admin/runai-setup/access-control/rbac/?h=create+delete+app#create-or-delete-rules). Make sure you assign the correct rules to your application. Use the [Roles](https://docs.run.ai/latest/admin/runai-setup/access-control/rbac/?h=create+delete+app#roles) to assign the correct access rules.  To get your access token, follow the instructions in [Request a token](https://docs.run.ai/latest/developer/rest-auth/#request-an-api-token).

    """
    Pydantic class model representing Security overrideable fields. In the context of assets,these are environment asset fields that can be overriden in the submit workload request..

    Parameters:
        ```python
        run_as_uid: Optional[int]
        run_as_gid: Optional[int]
        supplemental_groups: Optional[str]
        ```
        run_as_uid: The user id to run the entrypoint of the container which executes the workspace. Default to the value specified in the environment asset &#x60;runAsUid&#x60; field (optional). Use only when the source uid/gid of the environment asset is not &#x60;fromTheImage&#x60;, and &#x60;overrideUidGidInWorkspace&#x60; is enabled.
        run_as_gid: The group id to run the entrypoint of the container which executes the workspace. Default to the value specified in the environment asset &#x60;runAsGid&#x60; field (optional). Use only when the source uid/gid of the environment asset is not &#x60;fromTheImage&#x60;, and &#x60;overrideUidGidInWorkspace&#x60; is enabled.
        supplemental_groups: Comma separated list of groups that the user running the container belongs to, in addition to the group indicated by runAsGid. Use only when the source uid/gid of the environment asset is not &#x60;fromTheImage&#x60;, and &#x60;overrideUidGidInWorkspace&#x60; is enabled. Using an empty string implies reverting the supplementary groups of the image.
    Example:
        ```python
