NVIDIA Run:ai

# Introduction  The NVIDIA Run:ai Control-Plane API reference is a guide that provides an easy-to-use programming interface for adding various tasks to your application, including workload submission, resource management, and administrative operations.  NVIDIA Run:ai APIs are accessed using *bearer tokens*. To obtain a token, you need to create a **Service account** through the NVIDIA Run:ai user interface. To create a service account, in your UI, go to Access → Service Accounts (for organization-level service accounts) or User settings → Access Keys (for user access keys), and create a new one.  After you have created a new service account, you will need to assign it access rules. To assign access rules to the service account, see [Create access rules](https://run-ai-docs.nvidia.com/saas/infrastructure-setup/authentication/accessrules#create-or-delete-rules). Make sure you assign the correct rules to your service account. Use the [Roles](https://run-ai-docs.nvidia.com/saas/infrastructure-setup/authentication/roles) to assign the correct access rules.  To get your access token, follow the instructions in [Request a token](https://run-ai-docs.nvidia.com/saas/reference/api/rest-auth/#request-an-api-token).

class AuthorizationType(str, Enum):

    Specifies who can access the connection URL: - `authenticatedUsers`: Any authenticated user or service account can access the URL; the authorizedUsers and authorizedGroups fields are ignored. - `authorizedUsers`: Only users listed in the authorizedUsers field are allowed to access the URL; the authorizedGroups field is ignored. - `authorizedGroups`: Only members of user groups listed in the authorizedGroups field are allowed to access the URL; the authorizedUsers field is ignored. If not specified, authorization is determined by whether authorizedUsers or authorizedGroups is present. If both fields are set, this results in an error. If neither is set, any authenticatedUser can access.

    Allowed enum values:

    AUTHENTICATEDUSERS = 'authenticatedUsers'

    AUTHORIZEDUSERS = 'authorizedUsers'
