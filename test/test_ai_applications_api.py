NVIDIA Run:ai

# Introduction  The NVIDIA Run:ai Control-Plane API reference is a guide that provides an easy-to-use programming interface for adding various tasks to your application, including workload submission, resource management, and administrative operations.  NVIDIA Run:ai APIs are accessed using *bearer tokens*. To obtain a token, you need to create a **Service account** through the NVIDIA Run:ai user interface. To create a service account, in your UI, go to Access → Service Accounts (for organization-level service accounts) or User settings → Access Keys (for user access keys), and create a new one.  After you have created a new service account, you will need to assign it access rules. To assign access rules to the service account, see [Create access rules](https://run-ai-docs.nvidia.com/saas/infrastructure-setup/authentication/accessrules#create-or-delete-rules). Make sure you assign the correct rules to your service account. Use the [Roles](https://run-ai-docs.nvidia.com/saas/infrastructure-setup/authentication/roles) to assign the correct access rules.  To get your access token, follow the instructions in [Request a token](https://run-ai-docs.nvidia.com/saas/reference/api/rest-auth/#request-an-api-token).
